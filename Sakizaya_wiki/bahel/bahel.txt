飛、飛翔或飛行是物體的一種行進方式。方法有許多種，例如利用與空氣動力學原理產生升力（如飛機或鳥類）；也可以經由比空氣更輕的重量來達成目的（如熱氣球）；還有一種飛行方式並不在空氣當中，而是在太空裡，稱為太空飛行。在虛構作品中，也有人假想能利用魔法或超自然力量、超能力來飛行。
Flight is the process by which an object moves, through an atmosphere or beyond it, as in the case of spaceflight. This can be achieved by generating aerodynamic lift, propulsive thrust, aerostatically using buoyancy, or by ballistic movement. Many things fly, from natural aviators such as birds, bats and insects to human inventions such as missiles, aircraft such as airplanes, helicopters and balloons, to rockets such as spacecraft. The engineering aspects of flight are the purview of aerospace engineering which is subdivided into aeronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through the air, and astronautics, the study of vehicles that travel through space, and in ballistics, the study of the flight of projectiles.
